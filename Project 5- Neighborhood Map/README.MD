# Neighborhood Map Application

#### Note:
I was able to complete most of this project on my own using my experience and
code from previous lessons.  I had a lot of trouble with the Yelp API so I
used a [Udacity forum discussion](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/yelp-v3-implementation/235928/18/) for a good
starting point.  I got stuck again with the API [so I asked my own question](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/yelp-v3-very-close-please-help/493752/3/).
Unfortunately, it wasn't helpful for me and I remain stuck.  The first reviewer did not help with code revisions
for the API: instead, all they gave me links to the Yelp API documentation,
which I have already tried using.

I also had issues with my filter using [the Knockout template](http://www.knockmeout.net/2011/04/utility-functions-in-knockoutjs.html) so I posted another
[question](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/filter-from-knockout-error/506443) on the forum for feedback but wasn't able to find a solution.


## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop a single page application featuring a
map and neighborhood or neighborhood you would like to visit.  I decided to
create my project on popular locations near my house.  After that, you add
functionality to the map by including highlighted locations, third-party data
about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

### Lessons Learned
I already expected to do a good amount of self-guided work with this project.
Working through this project on my own, I was able to improve my web-navigating
skills by learning the right search techniques to troubleshoot code.  Now that I
am finished with this project, I am a lot more comfortable with looking through
code and I can understand what is happening line by line.  This project also
taught me how to use important third-party libraries, like Knockout, to my
advantage.  Finally, I learned how to separate the model and view from the
application and from each other so that I can work on different components
without impacting the others.  I can work on the structure of the data and how
the user interacts with it at the same time!
