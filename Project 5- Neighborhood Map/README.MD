# Neighborhood Map Application

The purpose of this project is to develop a single page application featuring a
map and neighborhood or neighborhood you would like to visit.  I decided to
create my project on popular locations near my house.  After that, you add
functionality to the map by including highlighted locations, third-party data
about those locations and various ways to browse the content.


## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open map.index


## Files Included
#### map.index
Where the magic happens

#### js (folder)
JavaScript needed to run with index.html.  Includes the [Knockout library](http://knockoutjs.com/)

#### css (folder)
Added for style

#### yelp-fusion(folder)
Folder including the API information for Yelp.  Work in progress


## Lessons Learned
I already expected to do a good amount of self-guided work with this project.
Working through this project on my own, I was able to improve my web-navigating
skills by learning the right search techniques to troubleshoot code.  Now that I
am finished with this project, I am a lot more comfortable with looking through
code and I can understand what is happening line by line.  This project also
taught me how to use important third-party libraries, like Knockout, to my
advantage.  Finally, I learned how to separate the model and view from the
application and from each other so that I can work on different components
without impacting the others.  I can work on the structure of the data and how
the user interacts with it at the same time!
